To run, follow preprocess_notebook.ipynb to preprocess images for IDL, then after tracking with IDL, use trk_preprocess to perform quality control and preprocess the tracks, then use fcsApp to extract HMM, autocorrelation, and cross correlation data.
To change file type, designate your own reader or use one of the existing readers in ht2.readers.py. Currently only accepts TCYX files, will implement a reader/pipeline that incorporates multiple fields of view and performs maximum Z projection. 

If you are having problems with the tracking, such as spots not beginning on the first frame or localize hanging on specific frames with bright spots, use prepend_im notebook to replace the first frame with a better frame using the frame index given by localize.

# TODO: replace localizeApp, replace btrack, replace fcsApp with native python
